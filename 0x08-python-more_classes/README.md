# Rectangle Class Project

This project involves implementing a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with various features and methods. The project consists of several tasks, each building upon the previous one, aimed at demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

## Task 0: Simple Rectangle

In this task, you will write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle. The class should not import any module.

## Task 1: Real Definition of a Rectangle

Define a class `Rectangle` with the following private instance attributes and their corresponding property methods:

- `width`: Must be an integer, greater than or equal to 0.
- `height`: Must be an integer, greater than or equal to 0.

## Task 2: Area and Perimeter

Extend the `Rectangle` class to include methods for calculating the area and perimeter:

- `area()`: Returns the rectangle area.
- `perimeter()`: Returns the rectangle perimeter.

## Task 3: String Representation

Implement string representation methods for the `Rectangle` class:

- `__str__()` and `__repr__()` should print the rectangle using the character `#`.

## Task 4: Eval is Magic

Add a static method to the `Rectangle` class that returns a dictionary representation of a rectangle. The method should take a rectangle object as an argument.

## Task 5: Detect Instance Deletion

Override the `__del__()` method in the `Rectangle` class to print a message when an instance of `Rectangle` is deleted.

## Task 6: How Many Instances

Add a class variable that counts the number of instances of the `Rectangle` class.

## Task 7: Change Representation

Update the string representation of the `Rectangle` class to include the width and height in the format `Rectangle(width, height)`.
