# Python - Everything is Object

This project is about understanding Python's object model and how variables, assignments, and memory references work. It covers concepts such as mutability, immutability, references, and aliasing, which are essential for mastering Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using Google:

- What is an object?
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance?
- What is the difference between an immutable object and a mutable object?
- What is a reference?
- What is an assignment?
- What is an alias?
- How to determine if two variables are identical?
- How to determine if two variables are linked to the same object?
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?
- What are mutable and immutable types?
- What are Python’s built-in mutable types?
- What are Python’s built-in immutable types?
- How does Python pass variables to functions?

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### .txt Answer Files
- Only one line is allowed.
- No Shebang in .txt files.
- All files should end with a new line.
