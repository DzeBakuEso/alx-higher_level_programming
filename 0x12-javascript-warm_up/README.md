## Background Context  
JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for many applications. In this project, JavaScript will be used for two primary purposes:  

1. **Scripting:** Similar to Python, this involves writing scripts to automate tasks and solve problems.  
2. **Web Front-end:** This sets the stage for making the AirBnB project dynamic using JavaScript and JQuery in future projects.  

For now, the focus will be on learning the basic concepts of the language through scripting.
