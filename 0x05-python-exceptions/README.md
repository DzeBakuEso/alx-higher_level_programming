# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## Project Overview
This project is focused on learning how to handle errors and exceptions in Python. It will help in understanding the distinction between errors and exceptions, how to catch and raise exceptions, and how to manage clean-up actions after an exception occurs.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using external resources:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome.
- The difference between errors and exceptions.
- What exceptions are and how to use them.
- When to use exceptions.
- How to properly handle exceptions.
- The purpose of catching exceptions.
- How to raise built-in exceptions.
- When and why to implement clean-up actions after an exception.

## Resources
Read or watch:
- [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
- Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling (starting at minute 7)

## Project Requirements
### General
- Editors allowed: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all Python files must be: `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code must follow the Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- File length will be tested using `wc`.

## Tasks

### 0. Safe list printing
Write a function that prints `x` elements of a list.  
Prototype: `def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):`

### 1. Safe printing of an integers list
Write a function that prints an integer using `"{:d}".format()`.  
Prototype: `def safe_print_integer(value):`

### 2. Print and count integers
Write a function that prints the first `x` elements of a list, only printing integers.  
Prototype: `def safe_print_list_integers(my_list=[], x=0):`

### 3. Integers division with debug
Write a function that divides two integers and prints the result.  
Prototype: `def safe_print_division(a, b):`

### 4. Divide a list
Write a function that divides element by element two lists.  
Prototype: `def list_division(my_list_1, my_list_2, list_length):`

### 5. Raise exception
Write a function that raises a type exception.  
Prototype: `def raise_exception():`

### 6. Raise a message
Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.  
Prototype: `def raise_exception_msg(message=""):`
